    "As described in {cite}`albin2019blockingdualityp`, every family of objects $\\Gamma$ has a natural dual family $\\hat{\\Gamma}$, called the *blocker* of $\\Gamma$.  These families are connected through modulus by the property that\n",

    "\\text{Mod}_{p,\\sigma}(\\Gamma)^{\\frac{1}{p}} =\n",
    "\\text{Mod}_{q,\\hat{\\sigma}}(\\hat{\\Gamma})^{\\frac{1}{q}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p\\in(1,\\infty)$, $q=p/(p-1)$ is its HÃ¶lder conjugate exponent, and where $\\hat{\\sigma}=\\sigma^{-\\frac{q}{p}}$.  Moreover, the unique optimal density $\\rho^*$ for the first modulus problem and $\\eta^*$ for the second are related as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}(e)\\eta^*(e)^q}{\\text{Mod}_{q,\\hat{\\sigma}}(\\hat{\\Gamma})} =\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, however, the optimal densities are generally nonunique, making it harder to establish a simple relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting blocking duality correctly requires a specific representation of the objects $\\gamma\\in\\Gamma$.  Namely, we identify each $\\gamma\\in\\Gamma$ with its corresponding usage vector $\\mathcal{N}(\\gamma,e)$.  In this way, we think of $\\Gamma\\subset\\mathbb{R}^E_{\\ge 0}$.\n",

The dual family $\\hat{\\Gamma}$ is simply this set of extreme points, where we again use the representation of objects by their usage vectors.\n",

    "1. When $\\Gamma$ is the family of $st$-paths, $\\hat{\\Gamma}$ has a very simple interpretation; it is the family of minimal $st$-cuts (with a $(0,1)$ usage matrix).  See if you can convince yourself that every minimal $st$-cut is present in the figure above.  This fact is essentially why the max-flow min-cut theorem is true, and it is sometimes helpful to think of this type of duality as a generalization of max-flow min-cut to other families of objects."

    "Notice that the blocking family has all 6 minimal $st$-cuts we saw before (with the usual usage matrix).  Additionally, it has two cuts that separate $s$ and $t$ on one side from $u$ on the other.  For these cuts, the usage vector only needs to take the value $1/2$ because any walk in our family needs to cross such a cut twice.  This gives a pretty good indication of what the blocking family should be.  To our knowledge, however, this has not yet been proved."
