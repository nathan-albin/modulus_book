    "The goal of this book is to introduce a collection of Python routines to explore the concept of the modulus of a family of objects $\\Gamma$ on a discrete graph $G=(V,E)$.  Roughly speaking, modulus is a framework for quantifying the \"richness\" of the family $\\Gamma$.  Before we define modulus, therefore, it make sense to consider what is meant by a family of objects.  As will become apparent in later chapters, there aren't many obvious constraints on the type of graph considered.  For example, the graph may be finite or infinite, it may be directed or undirected, it may even contain parallel edges or self loops.  Modulus is a flexible framework that can be adapted to many settings.  However, for developing an intuition about modulus, it helps to consider something concrete; for now, consider a finite, simple, undirected graph $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, there is a great deal of flexibility in what is considered to be an \"objects\".  A good starting point is to consider $\\Gamma$ to be some collection of subsets of edges. That is, $\\Gamma\\subseteq 2^E$.  While it is certainly possible to define more complicated notions of \"object,\" families of edge subsets are already sufficiently rich to demonstrate the modulus framework.  For now, then, we shall think of $\\Gamma$ as a collection of subsets of edges.  Some possible choices to keep in mind are:\n",
    "- the family of all paths connecting two specified distinct nodes\n",
    "- the family of all cuts separating two specified distinct nodes\n",
    "- the family of all spanning trees of $G$\n",
    "- the family of all cycles in $G$\n",
    "- the family of all triangles in $G$\n",
    "- the family of all stars in $G$\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, we may identify each object $\\gamma$ in the family $\\Gamma$ with the set of edges used by the object.  For example, a path can be identified with the collection of edges it crosses.  A convenient way to keep track of this information is via the $\\Gamma\\times E$ *usage matrix* $\\mathcal{N}$, whose entries are defined as\n",
